Project Purpose 
The purpose of an Intrusion Detection System project is to develop a system that can monitor and analyze network traffic data to identify and detect any unauthorized access or malicious activities in the network. The goal is to identify different types of attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, exploits, backdoors, etc., and alert network administrators or security teams to take appropriate actions to prevent or mitigate the impact of such attacks. The project aims to implement various machine learning algorithms to train and test the system on network traffic data, and potentially use feature selection techniques like PCA to improve the performance of the system.
